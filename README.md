## Notes
1. screencasting - cool
2. pythontutor links - cool
    - a great idea to visualize python stack frames / objects in memory
3. github - good [link](https://github.com/reuven/python-workout)
    - doubling solutions in jupyter notebook - good
    - sometimes notebooks are too large to display them on github website
4. website - good https://pythonworkout.com/
    - however, custom landing page would be better
5. exercises:
    - "three additional exercises" format is perfect, no more no less
    - most of the exercises are too easy
    - did not enjoy kind of exercises: those that are linked to other exercises several previous chapters
